# vimrc

My VIM setup. 

This is for personal use, I do not shy away from heavy hitory rewriting.

## Requirements

* Vim 8

## Installation

Symlink the repo to ~/.vim:

```
jvf@mb:~/repos/vimrc/ $ ln -s $PWD/ ~/.vim
```

## Plugin Handling

Plugins are added as native packages to `pack/jvf/start/`. No extra plugin manager is used. This requires Vim 8. See :h packages for more information.
